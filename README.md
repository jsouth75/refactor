# Refactor

## Description

I refactored this site by first reorganizing the structure, aligning elements to make it easier to read, and made it more accessible. Please see all the changes made below.  
1.  Gave this site the title "Horiseon" then moved above the css link to fall in sequential     order
2.  Added the id attribute before class attributeon line 36, so that it functioned correctly 
3.  Added the alt attribute on lines 38, 46, 54, 65, so if for some reason the image cannot be viewed
4.  Consolidated the redundant commands for .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost
5.  Consolidated the redundant commands for .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3
6.  Consolidated the redundant commands for .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img
7.  Consolidated the redundant commands for .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing
8.  Consolidated the redundant commands for .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img
9.  Consolidated the redundant commands for .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2
